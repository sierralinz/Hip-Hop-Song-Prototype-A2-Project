# Hip-Hop-Song-Prototype-A2-Project

An EarSketch project created to learn the basics of coding through music, and emulate the creativity and energy of contemporary Hip-Hop.

**Introduction**  

This project, **“Hip-Hop Song Prototype”** was my first attempt at coding with creativity.  
Using the Earsketch platform, I wrote Python code to build a short hip-hop track that mirrors the essence of artists like Tyler the Creator and Kendrick Lamar.  This prototype  helped me understand how music and programming logic can work together.  

**Purpose**  

The main goal of this project was to learn Python in a hands-on, creative way, by:  
- Writing and organising code that produces sound  
- Understanding how loops, timing, and functions work in practice  
- Seeing how structure (like intro, verse, and outro) can be represented through code  

**Technologies**  

- Language: Python  
- Platform: [EarSketch Online IDE](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/)  
- Library: EarSketch API  
- Tempo: 90 BPM (classic hip-hop tempo)

**Set up/how to run
**
1. Go to [https://earsketch.gatech.edu](https://earsketch.gatech.edu).  
2. Create an account or continue as a guest
3. Copy and paste the full Python code into the code editor 
4. Press 'run' to generate and play the track
5. (optional) Download as MP3 file
   
**What I Learned  
**

From building this prototype, I learned how to:  
- Use functions like (`init()`, `fitMedia()` and `setEffect()`) to control musical structure and composition
- Organise sounds and beats using tracks and measures
- Add audio effects like fade-ins and reverb through code  
- Read and write commented code that others (and future me) can understand  
- Apply creative thinking to technical learning, turning code into art and a mode of personal expression and identity

**Project Structure  
**

Intro | Piano & hi-hat fade-in | 1–4 |
Verse 1 | Main beat + soft vocals | 3–7 |
Chorus | Layered vocals, bass & synths | 7–14 |
Verse 2 | Short variation | 10–12 |
Switch-Up | New sound texture | 13–24 |
Outro | Reverb & fade-out | 24–29 |

**Inspiration & Credits

This prototype was created through the Earsketch learning platform, which teaches coding concepts through music production, in addition to

All sound samples and loops are from the Earsketch sound library.
