# Hip-Hop-Song-Prototype-A2-Project

A short, beginner-friendly EarSketch project created to learn the basics of coding through music.

**Introduction**  

This project, **“60-Second Hip-Hop Prototype,”** was my first attempt at coding with creativity.  
Using the [EarSketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/) platform, I wrote Python code to build a short hip-hop track that mirrors the essence of artists like Tyler the Creator and Kendrick Lamar.  
This prototype  helped me understand how music and programming logic can work together.  

**Purpose**  

The main goal of this project was to learn Python in a hands-on, creative way, by:  
- Writing and organizing code that produces sound  
- Understanding how loops, timing, and functions work in practice  
- Seeing how structure (like intro, verse, and outro) can be represented through code  

**Technologies**  

- Language: Python  
- Platform: [EarSketch Online IDE](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/)  
- Library: EarSketch API  
- Tempo: 90 BPM (classic hip-hop tempo)

**Set Up/How to Run
**

1. Go to [https://earsketch.gatech.edu](https://earsketch.gatech.edu).  
2. Create a free account or continue as a guest.  
3. Copy and paste the full Python code into the code editor.  
4. Press 'run' to generate and play the track.  
5. (Optional) Download to export the final audio file

**What I Learned  
**

From building this prototype, I learned how to:  
- Use function (`init()`, `fitMedia()`, `setEffect()`) to control musical structure  
- Organize sounds and beats using tracks and measures
- Add audio effect like fade-ins and reverb using code  
- Read and write commented code that others (and future me) can understand  
- Apply creative thinking to technical learning — turning code into art

**Project Structure  
**

Intro | Piano & hi-hat fade-in | 1–4 |
Verse 1 | Main beat + soft vocals | 3–7 |
Chorus | Layered vocals, bass & synths | 7–14 |
Verse 2 | Short variation | 10–12 |
Switch-Up | New sound texture | 13–24 |
Outro | Reverb & fade-out | 24–29 |

**Inspiration & Credits  
**
This prototype was created through the **EarSketch learning platform by Georgia Tech**, which teaches coding concepts through music production.  

All sound samples and loops are from the **EarSketch sound library**.
